## Tree-Based Models

For this assignment, we will continue working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

![Fig 1. Houndoom, a Dark/Fire-type canine Pokémon from Generation II.](images/houndoom.jpg){width="200"}

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

**Note: Fitting ensemble tree-based models can take a little while to run. Consider running your models outside of the .Rmd, storing the results, and loading them in your .Rmd to minimize time to knit.**

### Exercise 1

Read in the data and set things up as in Homework 5:

- Use `clean_names()`
- Filter out the rarer Pokémon types
- Convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors

```{r}
pkm <- clean_names(pokemon)
head(pkm)

pkm <- filter(pkm, type_1 %in% c("Bug", "Fire", "Grass", "Normal", "Water", "Psychic"))
pkm$type_1<-factor(pkm$type_1)
pkm$legendary<-factor(pkm$legendary)
```
Do an initial split of the data; you can choose the percentage for splitting. Stratify on the outcome variable.
```{r}
set.seed(2500)
pkm_split <- initial_split(pkm, prop = 0.80,strata = type_1)
pkm_train <- training(pkm_split)
pkm_test <- testing(pkm_split)
dim(pkm_train)
dim(pkm_test)
```


Fold the training set using *v*-fold cross-validation, with `v = 5`. Stratify on the outcome variable.
```{r}
pkm_folds <- vfold_cv(pkm_train, v = 5, strata=type_1)
pkm_folds
```


Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`:

- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;
- Center and scale all predictors.
```{r}
pkm_recipe <- recipe(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk +
                           attack + speed + defense+hp+sp_def,
                         data = pkm_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(legendary,generation) %>% 
  step_center(all_predictors()) %>% 
  step_scale(all_predictors())
```


### Exercise 2

Create a correlation matrix of the training set, using the `corrplot` package. *Note: You can choose how to handle the continuous variables for this plot; justify your decision(s).*
```{r}
library(corrplot)
pkm_numer <- pkm_train %>%  # getting just the numeric data
  select_if(is.numeric)

pkm_cor <- cor(pkm_numer)  # calculating the correlation between each variable
pkm_cor_plot <- corrplot(pkm_cor,  # making the correlation plot
                               )#order = 'AOE',)
```


What relationships, if any, do you notice? Do these relationships make sense to you?

sp_defense and defense are similar
total and all attributes are similar

### Exercise 3

First, set up a decision tree model and workflow. Tune the `cost_complexity` hyperparameter. Use the same levels we used in Lab 7 -- that is, `range = c(-3, -1)`. Specify that the metric we want to optimize is `roc_auc`. 
```{r, cache=TRUE}
tree_spec <- decision_tree() %>%
  set_engine("rpart")
class_tree_spec <- tree_spec %>%
  set_mode("classification")

class_tree_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(class_tree_spec %>% set_args(cost_complexity = tune())) %>% 
  add_recipe(pkm_recipe)
  

param_grid <- grid_regular(cost_complexity(range = c(-3, -1)), levels = 10)

tune_res <- tune_grid(
  class_tree_wf, 
  resamples = pkm_folds, 
  grid = param_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)
autoplot(tune_res)
```


Print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? Does a single decision tree perform better with a smaller or larger complexity penalty?

The auc went down by increasing complexity, so it preform better with smaller complexity penalty

### Exercise 4

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing pruned decision tree on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
best_preforming <- collect_metrics(tune_res)
arrange(best_preforming,mean)
```
it is 0.6185


### Exercise 5

Using `rpart.plot`, fit and visualize your best-performing pruned decision tree with the *training* set.
```{r}
best_complexity <- select_best(tune_res)
class_tree_final <- finalize_workflow(class_tree_wf, best_complexity)
class_tree_final_fit <- fit(class_tree_final, data = pkm_train)

class_tree_final_fit %>%
  extract_fit_engine() %>%
  rpart.plot()
```

### Exercise 5

Now set up a random forest model and workflow. Use the `ranger` engine and set `importance = "impurity"`. Tune `mtry`, `trees`, and `min_n`. Using the documentation for `rand_forest()`, explain in your own words what each of these hyperparameters represent.
mtry is the number of predictors randomly sampled at each level,
trees is the number of trees in the single fit
min_n is the minimum number of data can be splited further

```{r}
library(ranger)
rand_for <- rand_forest() %>%
  set_engine("ranger", importance = "impurity") 
rand_for_spec <- rand_for %>%
  set_mode("classification")
rand_for_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(rand_for_spec %>% set_args(mtry = tune())
            %>% set_args(trees = tune()) %>% 
              set_args(min_n = tune())) %>% 
  add_recipe(pkm_recipe)
param_grid_1 <- grid_regular(mtry(range = c(1, 8)),trees(range = c(1, 8)),
                             min_n(range = c(1, 8)),levels = 8)



```

Create a regular grid with 8 levels each. You can choose plausible ranges for each hyperparameter. Note that `mtry` should not be smaller than 1 or larger than 8. **Explain why not. What type of model would `mtry = 8` represent?**
Because we only have 8 predictors that we need to use them for randomly seletion.
mtry = 8 represents not randomly choosing variables.

### Exercise 6

Specify `roc_auc` as a metric. Tune the model and print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? What values of the hyperparameters seem to yield the best performance?

```{r, cache=TRUE}
tune_res_1 <- tune_grid(
  rand_for_wf, 
  resamples = pkm_folds, 
  grid = param_grid_1, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)
autoplot(tune_res_1)
```
More trees have better preformance
It seems for mtry = 1, trees = 6, min_n = 8 have highest proformance

### Exercise 7

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing random forest model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
b_preform <- collect_metrics(tune_res_1)
arrange(b_preform, desc(mean))
```

### Exercise 8

Create a variable importance plot, using `vip()`, with your best-performing random forest model fit on the *training* set.
```{r}
best_rf <- select_best(tune_res_1, metric = "roc_auc")
best_rf


new <- rand_forest(mtry = 1, trees = 6, min_n = 8) %>% 
  set_engine("ranger", importance = "impurity") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")

rand_final_fit <- fit(new, formula = type_1 ~., data = pkm_train)


vip(rand_final_fit)
```

Which variables were most useful? Which were least useful? Are these results what you expected, or not?

sp_atk is the most useful one the name is the least useful one. I am surprised that total is not as useful as others. 

### Exercise 9

Finally, set up a boosted tree model and workflow. Use the `xgboost` engine. Tune `trees`. Create a regular grid with 10 levels; let `trees` range from 10 to 2000. Specify `roc_auc` and again print an `autoplot()` of the results. 
```{r}
boost_spec <- boost_tree() %>%
  set_engine("xgboost") %>%
  set_mode("classification")
boost_wf <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(boost_spec %>% set_args(trees = tune())) %>% 
  add_recipe(pkm_recipe)
tune_grid_2 <- grid_regular(trees(range=c(10,2000)), levels = 10)

tune_res_2 <- tune_grid(
  boost_wf, 
  resamples = pkm_folds, 
  grid = tune_grid_2, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)

autoplot(tune_res_2)
```

What do you observe?
The auc grows by increasing of tree numbers.

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing boosted tree model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*
```{r}
boost_preformance <- collect_metrics(tune_res_2)

arrange(boost_preformance, desc(mean))
```
It is with 673 trees.

### Exercise 10

Display a table of the three ROC AUC values for your best-performing pruned tree, random forest, and boosted tree models. Which performed best on the folds? Select the best of the three and use `select_best()`, `finalize_workflow()`, and `fit()` to fit it to the *testing* set. 
```{r}
df <- bind_rows("desicion_tree" = show_best(tune_res, metric = "roc_auc",n=3), 
                "rand_forest" = show_best(tune_res_1, metric = "roc_auc",n=3), 
                "boost_tree"= show_best(tune_res_2, metric = "roc_auc",n=3)
                , .id = "model")
df
final <- select_best(tune_res_1, metric = "roc_auc")

final_wf <- finalize_workflow(rand_for_wf, final)

final_fit <- fit(final_wf, data = pkm_train)


```

Print the AUC value of your best-performing model on the testing set. Print the ROC curves. Finally, create and visualize a confusion matrix heat map.
```{r}
augment(final_fit, new_data = pkm_test) %>%
  roc_auc(type_1,.pred_Bug,.pred_Fire,.pred_Grass,.pred_Normal,
          .pred_Water,.pred_Psychic)
```
```{r}
augment(final_fit,new_data=pkm_test)%>%
  roc_curve(type_1,.pred_Bug,.pred_Fire,.pred_Grass,.pred_Normal,
          .pred_Water,.pred_Psychic) %>% 
  autoplot()
```
```{r}
augment(final_fit,new_data=pkm_test)%>%
  conf_mat(truth=type_1,.pred_class)%>%
  autoplot(type="heatmap")
```

Which classes was your model most accurate at predicting? Which was it worst at?

It is most accurate for bug and least accurate at predicting Psychic.

### Exercise 11

Using the `abalone.txt` data from previous assignments, fit and tune a random forest model to predict `age`. Use stratified cross-validation and select ranges for `mtry`, `min_n`, and `trees`. Present your results. What was the model's RMSE on your testing set?

Reading the data , tidying the data and setting the recipe as in homework-2

```{r}
abalone <- read_csv(file = "D:/1/code/pstat131/data/abalone.csv")
abalone <- abalone %>% 
  mutate(age = rings + 1.5)

set.seed(2500)
abalone_split <- abalone %>% initial_split(strata = age, 
                                           prop = 0.80)
abalone_train <- training(abalone_split)
abalone_test <- testing(abalone_split)

abalone_folds <- vfold_cv(abalone_train, v = 5, strata=age)

abalone_recipe <- recipe(age ~ . , data = abalone_train) %>% 
  step_rm(rings) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_predictors())


```

setting up the random forest workflow
```{r}
library(ranger)
rand_for_spec_aba <- rand_forest() %>%
  set_engine("randomForest", importance = TRUE) %>%
  set_mode("regression") 

rand_for_wf_aba <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(rand_for_spec_aba %>% set_args(mtry = tune())
            %>% set_args(trees = tune()) %>% 
              set_args(min_n = tune())) %>% 
  add_recipe(abalone_recipe)
param_grid_aba <- grid_regular(mtry(range = c(1, 8)),trees(range = c(10, 100)),
                             min_n(range = c(1, 20)),levels = 4)



```
tune the trees
```{r, cache=TRUE}
tune_res_aba <- tune_grid(
  rand_for_wf_aba, 
  resamples = abalone_folds, 
  grid = param_grid_aba, 
  metrics = metric_set(rmse)
)
autoplot(tune_res_aba)
```
select the best model based on rmse
```{r}
best_aba <- select_best(tune_res_aba, metric = "rmse")

final_wf_aba <- finalize_workflow(rand_for_wf_aba,best_aba)

final_fit_aba <- fit(final_wf_aba, abalone_train)

augment(final_fit_aba, new_data = abalone_test) %>%
  rmse(truth = age, estimate = .pred)
```
it is 2.0999
